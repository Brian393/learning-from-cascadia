These relatively\n      small slugs were inserted into the middle of long metal tubes set within a\n      graphite core, so as to spark a chain reaction. As the uranium atoms broke\n      apart into fragments—that's \"nuclear fission\"—multiple transuranic\n      products were formed, including small quantities of highly radioactive\n      substances such as strontium-90, technetium-99, cesium-127, iodine-129 and\n      plutonium-239.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      During the fission process, the hot slugs were cooled by river water at a\n      rate of some 30,000 gallons per minute. Anti-corrosion chemicals such as\n      hexavalent chromium were added. There were no closed cooling circuits, no\n      heat exchangers, no steaming towers: the water was just pumped back to the\n      river after a few hours in a retention pond. Finally the slugs were pushed\n      all the way through the graphite core until they dropped into a pool of\n      water where the shortest-lived radioactive isotopes were allowed to decay\n      for a two to three-month period.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      A railroad car then conveyed the slugs to the processing plants on the\n      Central Plateau, three hundred feet above the river. There the aluminum\n      coating was dissolved in acid, exposing the radioactive materials. The\n      initial acid bath was followed by a series of complex chemical treatments,\n      each stripping away unwanted impurities, but also leaving behind hot\n      wastes and precipitates. Hanford processed nearly twenty million fuel rods\n      in the period from 1944 to 1987, yielding some seventy-four tons of\n      weapons-grade plutonium.\n    </p>\n\n    <img src=\"/images/PlutoniumButton.png\" class=\"fullwidth\" />\n    <div class=\"caption\">Finished product: a plutonium \"button\"</div>\n\n    <p>\n      Before you on the map is the real yield: a labyrinth of abandoned\n      buildings, collapsing tunnels, decaying pipes and equipment, rusting\n      drums, dried pools, contaminated ditches, pits and burial grounds, as well\n      as 177 leaking underground storage tanks holding roughly 56 million\n      gallons of radioactive waste. In recent years, the liquid component of\n      this waste has been transferred from the oldest single-shell tanks into 28\n      somewhat newer double-shell tanks. However, water has subsequently\n      infiltrated into the remaining sludge in some of the 149 older tanks,\n      while leaks have been reported in the newer ones. In the most recent major\n      incident, a sealed underground railroad tunnel leading to a\n      plutonium-uranium extraction plant located on the Central Plateau suddenly\n      collapsed, leaving a hole open to the sky.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Roll the mouse over the diagrams. Each piece of the legacy is identified\n      by an official name and number. On the Central Plateau, processing plants\n      are connected to storage tanks by a tangle of pipelines. The stains of\n      unplanned releases and migrating contamination sites envelop the ruins of\n      the wartime facilities. The remaining buildings are gradually being\n      disassembled by work crews, leaving only freshly capped underground tanks\n      and earth scraped bare by bulldozers. At the same time, however, new\n      buildings are constructed to support the cleanup effort, including a\n      $17-billion-plus vitrification plant which, if ever successfully\n      completed, would encase high-level radioactive was in impermeable glass\n      logs for storage across the centuries.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Pan the map to the reactor sites along the river (or just click\n      <span\n        class=\"link\"\n        @click=\"\n          emit('set-map-view', { center: [-119.542, 46.69], resolution: 5 })\n        \"\n        >here</span\n      >). Cooling water intakes and outfalls can be observed along the bank, as\n      well as large retention ponds nearer to the reactors. Process sewers snake\n      out in every direction, bearing witness to the large quantities of water\n      that bathed all the phases of production. Dumping sites and unplanned\n      releases are indicated with colored patches, just as on the Plateau.\n      Scroll the cursor over the black architectural footprints to see images of\n      the reactors themselves.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      What remains beyond the shrouded monuments is a deeper and more mobile\n      legacy: the contaminant plumes moving through the groundwater, toward the\n      river.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <Accordion>\n      <h3 slot=\"header\">sources</h3>\n      <p>Data sources for this page include:</p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"__blank\"></a></p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>\n      <p>-- <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></p>\n      <br />\n    </Accordion>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<style scoped>\n.flex {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n.flex div {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n}\n.flex img {\n  margin-right: 0.5em;\n}\n</style>\n<script>\nimport AppLightBox from \"../../components/AppLightBox.vue\";\nimport Accordion from \"../../components/Accordion.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"WatershedHanfordLegacy\",\n  components: {\n    Accordion,\n    AppLightBox,\n  },\n  methods: {\n    emit: function (method, args) {\n      this.$eventBus.emit(method, args);\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./WatershedHanfordLegacy.vue?vue&type=template&id=0286dafc&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./WatershedHanfordLegacy.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./WatershedHanfordLegacy.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./WatershedHanfordLegacy.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=0286dafc&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nimport \"./WatershedHanfordLegacy.vue?vue&type=style&index=1&id=0286dafc&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-0286dafc\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementVNode","src","slot","_createStaticVNode","_createTextVNode","href","target","rel","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","_hoisted_2","_hoisted_3","_hoisted_4","_hoisted_5","_createVNode","_component_Accordion","open","default","_withCtx","_hoisted_6","_hoisted_7","_","_hoisted_8","onClick","_cache","$event","$options","emit","center","resolution","_hoisted_17","_hoisted_18","_hoisted_19","_hoisted_20","_hoisted_21","_hoisted_22","_hoisted_23","_hoisted_24","_hoisted_25","_hoisted_26","_hoisted_27","_hoisted_28","_hoisted_29","name","components","Accordion","AppLightBox","methods","method","args","this","$eventBus","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
