All\n      these reactor sites are also surrounded by sinks of hexavalent chromium,\n      which was added as an anti-corrosion agent to the cooling water.\n      Hexavalent chromium is highly toxic to salmon in particular. It entered\n      the river in large quantities during the period of Hanford's active\n      operation.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Over the last decade, billions of gallons of groundwater have been pumped\n      out and filtered in a Herculean attempt to prevent further contamination.\n      Yet the plumes persist, and hexavalent chromium still reaches the\n      Columbia.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      On the Central Plateau, a massive Vitrification Plant is being constructed\n      in an attempt to seal the tank waste inside glass rods for permanent\n      burial. However, the $17-billion-and-counting \"Vit plant,\" underway since\n      2002, has been plagued by technical difficulties, delays and cost\n      overruns. High-level waste is not expected to be processed into glass\n      until 2036&mdash;if ever, according to more skeptical evaluations.\n    </p>\n\n    <img src=\"/images/WasteTank.jpg\" class=\"fullwidth\" />\n    <div class=\"caption\">Hanford waste tank under construction</div>\n\n    <p>\n      Try to imagine the life of a single-shell carbon steel tank, up to one\n      million gallons in capacity, welded together on site some fifty to seventy\n      years ago, then encased in concrete, buried beneath the desert and\n      gradually filled with chemical waste at high levels of radioactivity.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Caustic solutions including sodium nitrate, sodium hydroxide, sodium\n      aluminate and sodium phosphate are pumped to the tanks from neighboring\n      facilities built to extract uranium and plutonium from the spent fuel\n      slugs. Further solutions from equipment wash-downs are added to the mix.\n      Suspended in the chemical bath are radionuclides including uranium,\n      plutonium, strontium-90, cesium-137, americium-241 and technetium-99.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Over time, water infiltrates into many of the 149 single-shell tanks,\n      while others are subject to sustained high heat generated by the\n      chemicals.

Sixty-seven of the single-shell tanks eventually\n      leak.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      When environmental cleanup finally begins, the liquid component of the\n      waste is transferred from the leaking vessels to twenty-eight previously\n      constructed double-shell tanks, which themselves were built anywhere from\n      thirty to fifty years ago. Transfers are effected through existing\n      vertical pipes leading down into the tank, some of them only a foot\n      across. Extraordinarily dangerous vapors are released during the transfer\n      process, which is done by relatively unprotected workers wrestling with\n      pumps, pipes, remote-controlled devices and a plethora of plastic shrouds.\n      Two of the supposedly safer double-shell tanks have also leaked. And as\n      DOE acknowledges, chemical percipitates and radioactive waste remain\n      behind in the drained single-shells:\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"quote\">\n      <p>\n        \"What’s left inside the tanks today are saltcakes, a material with the\n        consistency of wet beach sand, and sludges.

Workers assigned to tank\n      operations, often without air supplies or even masks, suddenly catch one\n      bad breath of vapor. Just that breath can cause chemical burns in the\n      lungs, followed by lifetime health consequences that may include\n      neurological damage. In a frightening spate of events a few years ago,\n      over seventy workers received medical examinations for vapor incidents\n      during the period from March 2014 to September 2015. Statistics are hard\n      to come by where Hanford employee injuries are concerned, but the number\n      of workers seriously affected by vapor inhalation appears to run in the\n      hundreds since environmental cleanup began.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Other categories of workers have been exposed to airborne flakes of\n      plutonium, which can lodge inside the body and cause lung, kidney and bone\n      cancers. Thirty-one workers tested positive for plutonium inhalation after\n      an incident that occurred during the demolition of the Plutonium Finishing\n      Plant on June 8, 2017. In addition to entering their lungs, the\n      microscopic flakes also accumulated on their clothes and even made it into\n      their cars, carrying the contamination back to their homes and families.\n    </p>\n\n    <img src=\"/images/PFPworkers.jpg\" class=\"fullwidth\" />\n    <div class=\"caption\">Demolition of Plutionium Finishing Plant</div>\n\n    <p>\n      Workers and their advocates have pushed back. The Energy Employees\n      Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act was passed in October 2000.\n      It allows DOE nuclear workers to file claims for radiogenic cancers,\n      berryllium poisoning and silicosis. To date, some 53,000 workers across\n      the US have been awarded payouts capped at $400,000, for a total of\n      approximately $12 billion. In March 2018, Washington state legislation was\n      passed to relieve Hanford workers of the burden of proving which of the\n      1,500 vapor chemicals caused their illness (an impossible task in some\n      cases). And in September 2018, in response to the spate of vapor\n      incidents, the settlement of a Washington state lawsuit led to much more\n      stringent safety measures for tank workers, including the systematic use\n      of supplied air in vapor zones. These are major victories, which only\n      became possible over a decade after the close of the Cold War.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Local inhabitants have been a good deal less fortunate, such as the\n      Hanford \"downwinders\" exposed to iodine-129 and other radioactive\n      particles during the war. The immense majority of their cases (over three\n      thousand) were rejected in 2015 after two decades of grueling litigation.\n      DOE reportedly paid out a total of $60 million in legal fees, plus $7\n      million in compensation. And the official literature still tells you that\n      nuclear reactors are no more dangerous than the cosmic rays absorbed\n      during a flight across North America. The science of denial has been\n      pushed to such extremes that all knowledge about the health effects of\n      radioactive materials becomes dubious.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Hanford is about the slow movement of toxic compounds through bodies,\n      whether of soil, groundwater, river life or human flesh. Do the bodies in\n      power even care? In 2018 the Department of Energy announced plans to to\n      reclassify some of the solidified tank sludge as low-level waste, meaning\n      that it could simply be covered in a specialized concrete, known as\n      \"grout\" in cleanup jargon. The tank farms would then become de facto\n      nuclear graveyards&mdash;abandoned for eternity, not thousands of feet\n      underground in a natural chasm or a salt mine, but just a few feet below\n      the surface.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"video\">\n      <iframe\n        width=\"350\"\n        height=\"197\"\n        src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FDp7cCG6rk?rel=0;showinfo=0\"\n        frameborder=\"0\"\n        allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\n        allowfullscreen\n      ></iframe>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"caption\">A Culture of Silence at the Hanford Nuclear Site</div>\n\n    <br />\n    <Accordion>\n      <h3 slot=\"header\">sources</h3>\n\n      <p>Data sources for the plumes:</p>\n      <p>\n        --\n        <a\n          href=\"https://phoenix.pnnl.gov/apps/gisexplorer/index.html\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"nofollow\"\n          >Phoenix GIS Explorer</a\n        >\n      </p>\n      <br />\n    </Accordion>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<style scoped>\n.flex {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n.flex div {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n}\n.flex img {\n  margin-right: 0.5em;\n}\n</style>\n<script>\nimport AppLightBox from \"../../components/AppLightBox.vue\";\nimport Accordion from \"../../components/Accordion.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"WatershedHanfordPlumes\",\n  components: {\n    Accordion,\n    AppLightBox,\n  },\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      megaImages: [\n        {\n          src: \"/images/CascadiaMegaregionFullsize.jpg\",\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    emit: function (method, args) {\n      this.$eventBus.emit(method, args);\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./WatershedHanfordPlumes.vue?vue&type=template&id=5b420887&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./WatershedHanfordPlumes.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./WatershedHanfordPlumes.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./WatershedHanfordPlumes.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=5b420887&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nimport \"./WatershedHanfordPlumes.vue?vue&type=style&index=1&id=5b420887&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-5b420887\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementVNode","src","slot","style","_createStaticVNode","width","height","frameborder","allow","allowfullscreen","_createTextVNode","href","target","rel","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","_hoisted_2","_hoisted_3","_hoisted_4","_hoisted_5","_createVNode","_component_Accordion","open","default","_withCtx","_hoisted_6","_hoisted_7","_","_hoisted_8","_hoisted_31","_hoisted_32","_hoisted_33","_hoisted_34","_hoisted_35","_hoisted_36","_hoisted_37","name","components","Accordion","AppLightBox","data","megaImages","methods","emit","method","args","this","$eventBus","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
