It has one locked door, and no window. A little light\n        seeps in dustily between cracks in the boards, secondhand from a\n        cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar. In one corner of the\n        little room a couple of mops, with stiff, clotted, foul-smelling heads\n        stand near a rusty bucket. The floor is dirt, a little damp to the\n        touch, as cellar dirt usually is. The room is about three paces long and\n        two wide: a mere broom closet or disused tool room. In the room a child\n        is sitting. It could be a boy or a girl. It looks about six, but\n        actually is nearly ten. It is feeble-minded. Perhaps it was born\n        defective, or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition,\n        and neglect. It picks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with its\n        toes or genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the\n        bucket and the two mops. It is afraid of the mops. It finds them\n        horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still standing\n        there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come. The door is always\n        locked; and nobody ever comes, except that sometimes--the child has no\n        understanding of time or interval--sometimes the door rattles terribly\n        and opens, and a person, or several people, are there. One of them may\n        come in and kick the child to make it stand up. The others never come\n        close, but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes....<br /><br />They\n        all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come\n        to see it, others are content merely to know it is there. They all know\n        that it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do not,\n        but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city,\n        the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the\n        wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance\n        of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly\n        on this child's abominable misery.<br /><br />This is usually explained\n        to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they seem\n        capable of understanding; and most of those who come to see the child\n        are young people, though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to\n        see the child. No matter how well the matter has been explained to them,\n        these young spectators are always shocked and sickened at the sight.\n        They feel disgust, which they had thought themselves superior to. They\n        feel anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. They would\n        like to do something for the child. But there is nothing they can do. If\n        the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, if\n        it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing\n        indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and\n        beauty and delight of Omelas would wither and be destroyed. Those are\n        the terms. To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in\n        Omelas for that single, small improvement: to throw away the happiness\n        of thousands for the chance of the happiness of one: that would be to\n        let guilt within the walls indeed....<br /><br />At times one of the\n        adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to\n        weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all. Sometimes also a man or\n        woman much older falls silent for a day or two, and then leaves home.\n        These people go out into the street, and walk down the street alone.\n        They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through\n        the beautiful gates. They keep walking across the farmlands of Omelas.\n        Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman. Night falls; the\n        traveler must pass down village streets, between the houses with\n        yellow-lit windows, and on out into the darkness of the fields. Each\n        alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains. They go on. They\n        leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come\n        back. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most\n        of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is\n        possible that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are\n        going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.<br /><br /><em\n          >From a story by</em\n        >\n        <a\n          href=\"http://www.mccc.edu/pdf/eng102/Week%209/Text_LeGuin%20Ursula_Ones%20Who%20Walk%20Away%20From%20Omelas.pdf\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"nofollow\"\n          >Ursula K.

And like the dams and the fossil-fuel system,\n      it still fulfills its opulent promises for some people, even though it is\n      increasingly perceived by others as a threat.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The dams offer hydroelectric power and industrial development to most of\n      the Columbia Basin, while endangering the salmon and the cultural life of\n      the Native American tribes. The fossil-fuel system makes astonishing\n      contributions to human mobility, while placing the entire living planet in\n      jeopardy. Both of these are regional and planetary scale issues. Hanford\n      covers a much smaller territorial footprint, yet still it appears as a\n      hyperbolic case, because the fission products that sprang from its short\n      wartime fever will contaminate the soil and water for incommensurable\n      periods, stretching hundreds of thousands of years into the future.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Take the extreme end of the spectrum: iodine-129. It constitutes one of\n      the largest groundwater plumes on the Central Plateau and has a half-life\n      of 15.7 million years. Toward the other end of the temporal spectrum,\n      strontium-90, which is found near the river in particular, has a half-life\n      of only 8.8 years. Somewhere in the middle is plutonium-239, whose\n      production was Hanford's sole mission. Its half-life is a comparatively\n      modest twenty-four thousand years&mdash;a lapse of time which remains\n      thoroughly unimaginable in traditional human terms.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Let's take a temporal landmark with which inhabitants of the Pacific\n      Northwest have become somewhat familiar: the \n        <span\n        class=\"maplink\"\n        @click=\"\n          emit('set-map-view', { center: [-119.012, 46.3], resolution: 900 })\n        \"\n        >Ice Age Floods</span\n      >, whose\n      violently rushing waters carved the Willamette Valley and the impressive\n      canyons, mesas, and dry waterfalls of Washington's Channeled Scablands.\n      The floods were released by the periodic collapse of ice dams that held\n      back the meltwaters of glacial Lake Missoula. The inundations occurred\n      some thirteen to fifteen thousand years ago, well before the domestication\n      of animals or the invention of agriculture. These tumultuous floods entirely covered the Hanford site,\n      not once but many times. Can we imagine what might happen to the remaining\n      nuclear wastes in the next fifteen millennia&mdash;or even in the next 150\n      years?\n    </p>\n    <a\n      href=\"https://www.columbiariverkeeper.org/sites/default/files/2018-07/2018.6.1%20Hanford%20Vision%20Report_j_INTERACTIVE.pdf\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"nofollow\"\n      ><img src=\"images/CompetingVisions.png\" class=\"fullwidth\"\n    /></a>\n    <div class=\"caption\">Click the image for the pdf report<br /></div>\n\n    <p>\n      The \"seventh generation\" is a measure that Native Americans often use to\n      describe the stewardship responsibilities incurred by the harvest of\n      animals and plants, or by any other kind of exploitation. The idea is to\n      use the fruits of the land in a way that respects the plants and animals\n      and leaves equal benefit for others, as far down as the seventh\n      generation. Seven generations is roughly 150 years&mdash;a long time for\n      settlers whose North American ancestors might not even go back that far.\n      Still, it remains an imaginable period of time for any human being.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In 1999, the State and Tribal Working Group authored a report entitled\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/07/f53/STGWG_Closure_for_7th_Gen_Report_%282017%29.pdf\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"nofollow\"\n        >Closure for the Seventh Generation</a\n      >, which spells out local views of the standards to which the federal\n      Department of Energy should adhere in its environmental cleanup and\n      eventual handover of contaminated nuclear sites. In 2018 Dan Serres,\n      conservation director for Columbia Riverkeeper, drew inspiration from the\n      latest version of that report to assess DOE's most recent plans for the\n      Hanford site.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The state and tribal report stresses the fragility of so-called\n      \"institutional controls,\" such as land-use laws, KEEP OUT signs, or even\n      engineered fences and barriers that may not withstand the test of time.\n      This fragility matters a great deal, because in the future, people will\n      clearly want to use this land for many reasons. In the Columbia\n      Riverkeeper report, Dan Serres stresses the high value that \n        <span\n        class=\"maplink\"\n        @click=\"\n          emit('set-map-view', { center: [-119.516, 46.715], resolution: 7 })\n        \"\n        >large tracts of cleared land along a free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River</span\n      > will hold for Native Americans in particular, and indeed, for everyone. Will\n      guards be funded, will fences remain standing, will future users of the\n      site even notice rusting signs that once read DANGER or KEEP OUT?\n    </p>\n\n    <img src=\"images/HanfordSign.jpg\" class=\"fullwidth\" />\n\n    <p>\n      The question is crucially important because DOE now envisages reserving\n      certain portions of the Hanford site for \"industrial uses only,\" a\n      restriction that depends on the maintenance of institutional controls and\n      does not take into account either the desire of Native Americans to\n      inhabit lands that were traditionally theirs, nor the use of riverine\n      landscapes by visitors from nearby cities seeking recreation and another\n      perspective on life. The same question becomes even more relevant in light\n      of recently announced DOE plans to reclassify much of the radioactive\n      debris currently stored in leaking tanks on the Central Plateau as\n      \"low-level waste,\" and then simply pour concrete over it and leave it to\n      the elements. Apparently the seventh generation does not exist for DOE,\n      which nonetheless holds public responsibility for materials whose toxicty\n      is known to last for millennia.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Tribes, citizens and lawmakers in the states of Washington and Oregon, and\n      indeed, throughout Cascadia, have a very different vision of the natural\n      environment that they would like to enjoy and to leave to their children\n      and grandchildren, down to or even beyond the seventh generation. The\n      damming of the Columbia River and its tributaries, as well as the current\n      reckless exploitation of North American fossil-fuel reserves, can make\n      that vision appear as a cruel and hypocritical lie, no different in\n      substance from DOE's transparently inadequate plans for the future of\n      Hanford. Yet it's not a lie and it's not hypocrisy to believe in what\n      ought to be. Everything now depends on those who are ready to act on their\n      belief, and contribute to the struggle of tribal and state representatives\n      who do not accept the currently inadequate federal dictates. Art, science,\n      activism, education, the courts, the voting booths and the media are all\n      avenues for the beginning of a systemic change, which must ultimately be\n      embodied in our concrete economic life and in our day-to-day behaviors as\n      users of vulnerable and damaged lands.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Hanford, in particular, is both a real-life ecological disaster and a\n      potent symbol of the responsibility that we all have when it comes to\n      dealing with the legacies of twentieth-century modernism. That\n      responsibility informs the name of one of the key groups now working with\n      the problem: a group called The Hanford Challenge. The capacity to stick\n      with such a challenge, despite all its difficulties, is one of the most\n      important things that can be learned from ecological initiatives in\n      Cascadia. At stake is a reinterpretation and fresh use of the human\n      energies that created the problem in the first place. If three nuclear\n      reactors and an entirely new process for the extraction of plutonium from\n      spent fuel could be developed in the lapse of only two years, then why\n      can't we now find a way to face and undo the mistakes that were part and\n      parcel of past successes?\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The answer that we give to this question today and over the upcoming\n      decades will be remembered and lived every day by the seventh generation.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<style scoped>\n.flex {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n.flex div {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n}\n.flex img {\n  margin-right: 0.5em;\n}\n</style>\n<script>\nimport AppLightBox from \"../../components/AppLightBox.vue\";\nimport Accordion from \"../../components/Accordion.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"WatershedHanfordFloods\",\n  components: {\n    Accordion,\n    AppLightBox,\n  },\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      megaImages: [\n        {\n          src: \"images/CascadiaMegaregionFullsize.jpg\",\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    emit: function (method, args) {\n      this.$eventBus.emit(method, args);\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./WatershedHanfordFloods.vue?vue&type=template&id=03e1aa66&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./WatershedHanfordFloods.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./WatershedHanfordFloods.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./WatershedHanfordFloods.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=03e1aa66&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nimport \"./WatershedHanfordFloods.vue?vue&type=style&index=1&id=03e1aa66&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-03e1aa66\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementVNode","src","_createTextVNode","href","target","rel","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","_hoisted_2","_hoisted_3","_hoisted_4","_hoisted_5","_hoisted_6","_createVNode","_component_Accordion","open","default","_withCtx","_hoisted_7","_","_hoisted_8","_hoisted_9","_hoisted_10","_hoisted_11","onClick","_cache","$event","$options","emit","center","resolution","_hoisted_12","_hoisted_13","_hoisted_14","_hoisted_15","_hoisted_16","_hoisted_17","_hoisted_18","_hoisted_19","_hoisted_20","_hoisted_21","name","components","Accordion","AppLightBox","data","megaImages","methods","method","args","this","$eventBus","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
