It's a fish for a hungry family, a campsite for the houseless, a job for a sailor or a dock worker, a career for a state official. It's a hunting and gathering environment for native American tribes whose ceremonies go back to time immemorial. It's an aquatic world for thousands of species who live in it, on it, above it and along its banks. It's a joy for the eye and the spirit. Plus it's the site of massive industries, still operating or in ruins, and of future public parks rising out of the brownfields for everyone. Or maybe it'll just be a nice view for the million-dollar apartments of a gentrified city? Anyway, right now it's a current of clear cool water suffused with toxic substances that sink deep into layers of sediment and concentrate in the bodies of living organisms.</p>\n\n    <p>The Portland Harbor reach of the Willamette River has been polluted since the late nineteenth century. Up to the 1970s the main concern was raw sewage flushing directly into the stream. Major progress was made across the state under governor Tom McCall, from 1967 to 1975; but in Portland the sewage problem dragged on until the recent completion of the <a href=\"https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/31030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Pipe</a>, which captures most of the effluent that used to spill out from combined sewer and storm drain overflows. What remains at issue for the future is something quite different: a host of invisible chemicals lodged in the silt and sand of the riverbed, or leaching into the water from legacy debris and active industrial installations.</p>\n\n    <p>In 2000, after decades of struggle, the Portland Harbor was placed on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List, transforming it into what everyone still calls a Superfund site. As the 2000's rolled on, the EPA helped organize \"<a href=\"http://www.willametterivercleanup.com/earlyactions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">early actions</a>\" to address some of the ongoing disasters at surface level. When that was over, the waiting game began. The big questions were, what needs to be done, and who's gonna pay for it?</p>\n\n    <img src=\"images/Arkema.jpg\" class=\"fullwidth\">\n    <div class=\"caption\">Early intervention at former Arkema plant</div>\n\n    <p>It's hard for people to understand that EPA no longer has funds for anything but emergency work on its Superfund sites. A deal would therefore have to be struck with the devil, in order to get some of the over 150 Potentially Reponsible Parties (PRPs) to step up and pay for preliminary operations. Ten of the major corporate entities did so, later joined by four others, forming the <a href=\"http://lwgportlandharbor.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lower Willamette Group</a>. In an extremely dubious scenario of \"yes you can be judge and party on the same case,\" this group paid for and organized the initial scientific analysis that would later help determine its own cleanup responsibilities. As for those who did not step up, more backroom deals as well as extensive litigation will no doubt be required to get them on board.</p>\n\n    <p>Despite the cynicism and apathy that this kind of deal-making threatens to engender, the public weighed in massively during the final deliberations over the future of the Superfund site. Over 5,300 comments on the horrendously complex cleanup alternatives gave proof that \"citizen oversight\" is not a mere phrase. EPA then issued its long-awaited Record of Decision (ROD) in January of 2017. The unprecedented level of involvement had tipped the scales toward a more rigorous plan, known in poetic English as \"Alternative F Modified.\"</p>\n\n    <p>The 3,012-page <a href=\"https://semspub.epa.gov/work/10/100036257.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Record of Decision</a> stipulates exactly what the sources of pollution are (though that's not yet fully known), exactly which areas will be treated (but watch out for shrinking expectations), exactly which technologies will be employed (or at least the most basic categories), and how long all this will take (roughly sixteen to eighteen years). Plus there's an estimate of how much it's all going to cost (over $1 billion).

In parallel to this technical and scientific activity, the lawyers of the Potentially Responsible Parties are slugging it out behind closed doors, each trying to force the other to repent individually, in cash, for the collective misdeeds of the not-so-distant past.</p>\n\n    <p>Let's look at the map to see what all the hue and cry is about.</p>\n\n    <p>The areas marked in dark red are the so-called \"upland sites,\" where in some cases the pollution still washes right off the shore or leaches into the groundwater. The most dangerous substances found here are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an extremely long-lived class of toxins manufactured by Monsanto and used as flame-retardant lubricants and hydraulic fluids in a wide range of industrial processes. The City of Portland, the Port of Portland and the State of Oregon are all suing Monsanto in the attempt to recover some of their PCB cleanup costs.</p>\n\n    <p>Further contaminants include the pesticide DDT and its breakdown products, manufactured at the Arkema plant on the western bank at River Mile 7. Plus there are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, released from the burning of coal, oil, gasoline and assorted kinds of trash. And let's not forget the highly carcinogenic dioxins and furans which come out of various industrial processes, such as the creosote treatment operation at the McCormick & Baxter site on the eastern bank at RM-7. There are many other chemical pollutants and heavy metals on the banks of the Willamette, but the list above is the worst of the worst: the super-death-stars of the Superfund site.</p>\n\n    <img src=\"images/McCormick&Baxter.jpg\" class=\"fullwidth\">\n    <div class=\"caption\">Capping at McCormick & Baxter, 2004</div>\n\n    <p>Source control of toxic substances at the upland sites is handled by Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Each site has been ranked as high, medium or low priority, plus a final good-to-go category (\"source control complete or not needed\"). If you click on the polygons, a window appears with a link that takes you directly to DEQ's record of the site's condition, detailing the interventions that have been carried out or are still required.</p>\n\n    <p>To go a little further, it might be worth reading the report on the former GASCO oil-gasification site on the western bank between River Miles 6 and 7, now owned by a successor company that goes by the ironic name of Northwest Natural. Here an \"early action\" in 2005 dredged a 15,000 cubic-yard tarball out of the river, in hopes of stanching the flow of benzene, cyanide, naphtalene and PAHs into the environment. However this action was not sufficient, because large portions of the site, and of the neighboring Siltronic parcel, are still filled with tar leaching into the river. Northwest Natural loyally spent some $21 million on a groundwater treatment system to take care of the problem. </p>\n\n    <p>The last DEQ report, dated 2012, puts it like this: \"Removal action consists of a well-based hydraulic control and containment system that is also being implemented as a groundwater source-control measure along ~2,200 feet of NW Natural's and Siltronic Corporation shorelines.\" Sounds impressive&mdash;but a group of downriver corporations including BP, Exxon-Mobil and Toyota <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-harbor-superfund-cleanup-oregon-epa-tar-globes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">now claim</a> that tar is still flowing into the water, and that Northwest Natural should pay for its removal. Is it true, or is it some complex strategy within the blame-game of the current \"allocation\" phase of superfund responsibilities? Northwest Natural, for its part, is preparing to spend five times more than its initial $21 million outlay, in order to nix the remaining pollutants that it claims are safely sequestered on its own property.</p>\n\n    <img src=\"images/NWNatural.jpg\" class=\"fullwidth\">\n    <div class=\"caption\">Groundwater treatment at former GASCO site</div>\n\n    <p>Finally, the most difficult question: how to deal with \"potential threat waste\" (chemicals and heavy metals) that has already made its way into the riverbed? To see EPA's plans, you have to <span class=\"link\" @click=\"emit('set-map-view', {center: [-122.734, 45.572], resolution: 5, minResolution: 0.125, maxResolution: 400})\">zoom in</span> a little.</p>\n\n    <p>Here's the thing: removal by dredging is the best option, except that dredging risks releasing trapped toxins for fresh dispersal in the river. Every decision about what to do with particular pollutants under particular riverbed conditions must square this vicious circle.</p>\n\n    <p>Fortunately after sixteen years of study, EPA has come up with a short list of possible interventions. So far they are deceptively simple: dredge it, cap it with sand so it doesn't move, dredge it and cap it, or just leave it in place under the delicate attentions of \"enhanced natural recovery\" (whatever that means). The matter is complicated by the fact that many of the areas where pollutant levels require intervention are located in the navigation channel of the river, which was formerly maintained at a depth of forty feet, and which the Army Corps of Engineers is anxious to lower to 43 feet. In these \"future maintenance dredge\" zones, the sediment removal operations, with their associated caps or backfills, must be calculated to withstand future Army Corps intervention without the release of additional poisons into the water.</p>\n\n    <p>At the time of writing (November 2018), the civil-society overseers of this whole process are furious. According to EPA, <a href=\"https://semspub.epa.gov/work/10/100116881.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">new research</a> has shown that a specific PAH called benzo(a)pyrene is seven times less toxic than previously believed. This change in assumed toxicity would shrink the total area of intervention by about 17 acres and lower the cost by about $35 million. For sure, this is a relatively small adjustment to a $1 billion cleanup covering 2,200 acres. But benzo(a)pyrene is the first compound to ever have been associated with cancer: its toxic effect was observed way back in the eighteenth century. It has been considered highly carcinogenic throughout the twentieth century and up to today.
