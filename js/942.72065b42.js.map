In just a few hours, the\n      rapids that had roared through The Long Narrows since time immemorial were\n      silenced by the rising waters.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>What changed on that day?</p>\n\n    <p>\n      Celilo Falls was the oldest continuously inhabited site in North America.\n      Known as Wyam, it lay at the meeting-place between the Sahaptin and Upper\n      Chinookian language groups, and it attracted regular migrations of Native\n      Americans from across the West, who came there to fish and to celebrate\n      the First Salmon ceremony. The catch at the base of the falls, carefully\n      regulated by the Salmon Chief, was abundant beyond today's imagining. It\n      has been estimated that up to sixteen million salmon crossed the falls\n      every year&mdash;compared to the 1.2 million that made it over Bonneville\n      Dam in 2017.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The roaring river, the leaping salmon, the bustling fisherfolk at the\n      shore have left their traces in travelers' accounts and in tribal\n      memories.

A maze of islands\n      separated the small communities and provided fishing sites in the spring\n      and fall. The villages, each an autonomous political unit, faced the river\n      or the mouths of tributaries&mdash;anywhere the fishing was excellent and\n      accessible. The Indian population may have reached as many as 10,000 in\n      this nine-mile stretch of the river before postcontact disease devastated\n      the tribes.\"\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Despite the disasters of first contact, the summertime convergence at the\n      falls persisted into the middle of the twentieth century. The Yakama\n      Nation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and the Walla Walla,\n      Umatilla, and Cayuse peoples retained their treaty rights to fish at\n      Celilo up to the date of the flooding. They still retain those rights\n      today, but in a vastly different landscape.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Before the dams turned the wild river into a series of slackwater pools,\n      rapids and waterfalls had been scattered the length of the Columbia and of\n      its tributaries. Many were important fisheries and ceremonial sites, in\n      particular Kettle Falls, now underwater, drowned by the Grand Coulee Dam\n      (<span\n        class=\"link\"\n        @click=\"\n          emit('set-map-view', { center: [-118.109, 48.639], resolution: 120 })\n        \"\n        >zoom to Kettle Falls</span\n      >).

Their leader, Chief Joseph, had done\n      everything he could to find a path of coexistence between the new settlers\n      and his band, who resisted arbitrary relocation to Idaho. Reflecting on\n      the band's flight, pursuit and defeat in the tumultuous \"Nez Perce War\" of\n      1877, he seemed to see into the future:\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"quote\">\n      \"I learned that we were but few, while the white men were many, and that\n      we could not hold our own with them. We were like deer. They were like\n      grizzly bears. We had a small country. Their country was large. We were\n      contented to let things remain as the Great Spirit Chief made them. They\n      were not; and would change the rivers and mountains if they did not suit\n      them.\"\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      In 1955, the Chief Joseph Dam was built on the Columbia River, at the edge\n      of the Colville Reservation where Joseph himself had died in exile in\n      1904. It was part of a larger process, driven by the economy and the\n      state, which would almost entirely transform both the river and the world\n      around it.\n    </p>\n\n    <br />\n    <Accordion>\n      <h3 slot=\"header\">sources</h3>\n    </Accordion>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<style scoped>\n.flex {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n.flex div {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n}\n.flex img {\n  margin-right: 0.5em;\n}\n</style>\n<script>\nimport AppLightBox from \"../../components/AppLightBox.vue\";\nimport Accordion from \"../../components/Accordion.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"WatershedDamsFalls\",\n  components: {\n    Accordion,\n    AppLightBox,\n  },\n  methods: {\n    emit: function (method, args) {\n      this.$eventBus.emit(method, args);\n    },\n  },\n};\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./WatershedDamsFalls.vue?vue&type=template&id=36346912&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./WatershedDamsFalls.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./WatershedDamsFalls.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./WatershedDamsFalls.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=36346912&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nimport \"./WatershedDamsFalls.vue?vue&type=style&index=1&id=36346912&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-36346912\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementVNode","width","height","src","frameborder","allow","allowfullscreen","_createTextVNode","slot","style","_createStaticVNode","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","_hoisted_2","_hoisted_3","_hoisted_4","_hoisted_5","_createVNode","_component_Accordion","open","default","_withCtx","_hoisted_6","_hoisted_7","_","_hoisted_8","onClick","_cache","$event","$options","emit","center","resolution","_hoisted_15","_hoisted_16","_hoisted_17","_hoisted_18","_hoisted_19","name","components","Accordion","AppLightBox","methods","method","args","this","$eventBus","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
