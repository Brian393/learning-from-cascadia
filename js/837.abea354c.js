Known as Wyam, it lay at the meeting-place between the Sahaptin and Upper Chinookian language groups, and it attracted regular migrations of Native Americans from across the West, who came there to fish and to celebrate the First Salmon ceremony. The catch at the base of the falls, carefully regulated by the Salmon Chief, was abundant beyond today&#39;s imagining. It has been estimated that up to sixteen million salmon crossed the falls every year—compared to the 1.2 million that made it over Bonneville Dam in 2017. </p><p data-v-216e4ecc> The roaring river, the leaping salmon, the bustling fisherfolk at the shore have left their traces in travelers&#39; accounts and in tribal memories.

Historian Katrine Barber describes the scene: </p><p class="quote" data-v-216e4ecc> &quot;At Celilo Falls, where the horseshoe-shaped precipice demanded portage, dozens of villages scattered about the shorelines. A maze of islands separated the small communities and provided fishing sites in the spring and fall. The villages, each an autonomous political unit, faced the river or the mouths of tributaries—anywhere the fishing was excellent and accessible. The Indian population may have reached as many as 10,000 in this nine-mile stretch of the river before postcontact disease devastated the tribes.&quot; </p><p data-v-216e4ecc> Despite the disasters of first contact, the summertime convergence at the falls persisted into the middle of the twentieth century. The Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and the Walla Walla, Umatilla, and Cayuse peoples retained their treaty rights to fish at Celilo up to the date of the flooding. They still retain those rights today, but in a vastly different landscape. </p>',7),m=s((()=>(0,o.Lk)("p",null,' The Nez Perce of the Wallowa Valley were among those who depended on the salmon runs of Celilo Falls.
