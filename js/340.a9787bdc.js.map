The\n        following sections of the map have been developed with an advocacy\n        group,\n        <a href=\"https://columbiariverkeeper.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"\n          >Columbia Riverkeeper</a\n        >, in solidarity with dozens of regional organizations and with millions\n        of people.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>So what's the situation?</p>\n\n      <p>\n        From the 2000s onward North America has witnessed a surge in oil and gas\n        extraction, driven by the spread of unconventional techniques like\n        hydraulic fracking, but also by deliberate government policies. Wild\n        schemes, improvised crews, ramshackle equipment: nothing was too quick\n        or too dirty for the energy tycoons exploiting North Dakota's Bakken and\n        Canada's Tar Sands. But all that dinosaur blood needed deepwater ports\n        on the Pacific Ocean in order to reach the world's thirstiest markets in\n        Asia. Fortunateely there was something between the devil and the deep\n        blue sea: the environmentalists of Oregon, Washington and British\n        Columbia.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The Lower Columbia River, from Portland to the mouth of the estuary,\n        remains the multi-billion-dollar prize for the export industry. Here,\n        climate-wrecking energy can flow in by pipeline, or even worse, by rail,\n        and ocean-going tankers can carry it away from numerous underused ports\n        in two different states. Or at least, they could carry it away, if the\n        region's inhabitants would let that happen.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Over the last decade, a dozen proposed oil, coal and liquified natural\n        gas terminals have been stopped dead in the water. Taking a remarkable\n        step forward in December 2015, Portland's city council used zoning\n        regulations to pass a\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/557499\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"nofollow\"\n          >resolution</a\n        >\n        banning any installation of new fossil fuel terminals and any expansion\n        of previously existing ones. Successful protest movements continue\n        unfolding to this day. But on June 3, 2016, the fiery derailment of a\n        Union Pacific train carrying explosive Bakken crude through the Columbia\n        Gorge town of \n      <span\n        class=\"maplink\"\n        @click=\"\n          emit('set-map-view', { center: [-121.406, 45.685], resolution: 20 })\n        \"\n        >Mosier, Oregon</span\n      >, showed just how dangerous the commerce in\n        energy still is. And despite the disaster, moves are again underway to\n        increase oil-by-rail in the region. Success is always relative and\n        almost everything is yet to be done in the struggle against climate\n        change.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Click on the markers to see how an unprecedented spectrum of grassroots\n        activists, teachers, students, faith-based groups, health professionals,\n        unions, social-justice movements, tribes, environmentalists, NGOs and\n        principled public officials have held the\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.sightline.org/research/thin-green-line\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"nofollow\"\n          >Thin Green Line</a\n        >, blocking the implementation of some of the world's most devastating\n        energy plans. Each click shows a Twitter feed next to the site of an\n        abandoned terminal project. An extraordinary range of people tell the\n        story in their own words and images, with links to important press\n        accounts and to the websites of those who are directly defending the\n        river itself and the health of everyone on its shores.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This story is hardly over. Here's one last example. The orange markers\n        show two proposed sites for a methanol plant that would turn a flood of\n        fracked natural gas into useless plastic, polluting the air, the water\n        and the quality of all our lives.
