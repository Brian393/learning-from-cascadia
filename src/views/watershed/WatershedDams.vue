      Anyone who longs for wild rivers is going to be disappointed by the
      Columbia.
    </p>

    <p>
      The construction of small-scale dams for hydropower and flood control on the
      Columbia and Snake rivers began in 1901. The far larger
      Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams were federal projects of the Roosevelt
      era, carried out by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bueau of
      Reclamation and completed in 1937 and 1941 respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was when the state dreamed big. Bonneville would facilitate navigation
      and provide a bounty of hydroelectric power for economic development,
      while irrigation water from the Grand Coulee would literally make the desert bloom. A
      federal agency, the Bonneville Power Administration, would distribute the
      abundant electricity at low rates via a system of
      high-tension lines and substations stretching across the Columbia Basin.
      And a new institution, the fish hatchery, a kind of hospital or asylum for the ailing salmon, would mitigate whatever damage
      might be done to the natural world. The aim was to provide jobs and
      prospects for thousands of people left stranded by the Great Depression.
      Modernization and social progress were finally going to make it to the
      Pacific Northwest.

    <p>
      But the war had other plans. Electricity from Bonneville powered
      massive bauxite reduction plants for the aluminum needs of the aviation
      industry; while power from the Grand Coulee flowed directly into plutonium
      production at Hanford Nuclear Reservation. What emerged from the
      Roosevelt era was not egalitarian development for the people, but instead,
      Cold War imperial America.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Memorial Day, 1948, floods were allowed to entirely destroy the multi-racial
      workers' metropolis of Vanport, located on the riverbank between Vancouver
      and Portland. The flooding of Vanport then became the justification for the
      Columbia River Treaty with Canada. That treaty would turn the entire basin
      into a single hydroelectric facility, featuring extensive storage
      reservoirs in the Canadian headwaters and multiple generating facilities
      down the mainstem, plus further impoundments on the Snake River and
      other tributaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      As treaty negotiations with Canada dragged on, a veritable frenzy of dam-building
      seized the Pacific Northwest, with the future prospects of aluminum
      production, aviation, river commerce and recreation all dependent on
      increased hydrological control. Finally in 1964 the details of
      construction and compensation were haggled out, along with contracts for
      the sale of surplus Canadian hydroelectricity. The Columbia River Treaty
      was signed and the Mica, Duncan, Libby and Keenleyside dams were erected,
      creating an upriver storage system that canceled the chaotic surge of
      spring snowmelt.

    <p>
      At present the Pacific Northwest Coordination Agreement regulates the
      annual flow of the entire transborder system, in a highly computerized
      attempt at harmonizing the fluctuating demands of power production, flood
      control, navigation, recreation and the survival of endangered fish
      species. Within a single river reach -- such as the Lower, Middle or Upper
      Columbia -- as many as ten dams will synchronize their water releases on
      an hourly basis, producing a managed diurnal pulse that has become second
      nature. Not the vagaries of the snowpack or the afternoon weather, but a
      logic of efficiency and optimization shapes the flow of the Columbia
      River.
    </p>

    <p>
      The construction of the water-management system signified the entry into a
      new era, not yet called the Anthropocene. By the close of the 1970s, when
      the frenzy of dam-building passed its peak and the Cold War weapons boom
      began subsiding, all human and non-human inhabitants of the basin were
      faced with the new reality of the river, which the environmental historian
      Richard White characterized as an "organic machine." Within this
      framework, White explained, labor has not "conquered" nature. Instead the
      transformative labor of technological production "involves human beings
      with the world so thoroughly that they can never be disentangled."

    /></a>

    <p>
      Still there was at least one problem with this new union of humanity and
      nature. The vast system of dams was slowly wiping out the emblematic
      species of the Pacific Northwest, the salmon, whose numbers began
      precipitously declining even as Native American bands, tribes and nations
      began an historic effort to recover their ancestral rights by catching
      fish "in all the usual and accustomed places." As public support for
      indigenous treaty claims expanded along with environmentalism, the
      "organic machine" that had literally forged the region's prosperity began
      to look like an alien power that had locked itself upon the meanders of
      the river: a dead hand of cement choking off the lifeblood of Cascadia.

      In 1999, Ecotrust in Portland came out with the notion of
      <a
        href="https://ecotrust.org/publication/salmon-nation"
        target="_blank"
        rel="nofollow"
        >Salmon Nation</a
      >. An entirely new cosmovision swam into view, one which is not always
      explicitly described, but has nonetheless become quite tangible for an entire sector of the population. This new territorial identity was based on the practical experience of ecological restoration, and on the particular coalitions it involved. By helping to
      develop original forms of scientific expertise both within mainstream
      civil society and among the tribes, an expanded environmental movement
      sought fresh sources of agency within the legal and administrative
      arenas opened up by the Endangered Species Act. The latter had the force
      of law, transforming citizens' convictions and scientists' biological
      opinions into instruments of tangible change. What has emerged since the late 1990s,
      within and against the rigid machinery of the dams, are the lineaments of
      a new kind of governance&mdash;the upturned foundations of a future
      bioregional state.

    /></a>

    <p>
      Today, the preservation of Pacific salmon, the expansion of Native
      American treaty rights, the resistance to fossil-fuel infrastructure and
      the recovery of riverine and forest ecosystems have become strong
      political demands, with clearly identified constituencies and forms of
      political representation stretching across Cascadia. The result is a
      palpable difficulty in maintaining the old system. As the Columbia River
      Treaty is renegotiated, it's clear that the hydrostate isn't working
      anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the ongoing decline in the price of electricity&mdash;due
      particularly to the rise of solar in California&mdash;other facts about
      the dams have become apparent. Among them are the huge scars left on the
      landscape by constantly fluctuating water levels, even after the violence
      of forced population removal has faded. "These are industrial reservoirs.
      They are not lakes,” says Deb Kozak, the mayor of the city of Nelson in
      British Columbia. "These were advertised as lakes with great recreational
      opportunities when the dams were created. They are not."
    </p>

    <p>
      D.R. Michel, executive director of the Upper Columbia United Tribes, is
      even more forceful about the consequences of damming the river system:
      "It’s not just a machine to spin turbines and protect Portland. They
      permanently took the floods that happened annually down river and moved
      them up into our area, so we feel those impacts and those losses every
      day."
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the organic machine of the Columbia River, entanglement is the
      common condition. Salmon have emerged as totemic guides to a new kind of
      nation. Yet like the fish, we have to deal with what already exists. The
      real labor today is not returning to a wild state, but instead, finding a
      viable pulse for the Anthropocene metabolism.
